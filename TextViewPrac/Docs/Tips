difference between shouldBegin / didBegin

A "shouldBegin" something allows you to say NO on the return value to prohibit the action.

A "didBegin" something says it has just started to happen and you need to take whatever actions you need to do at that point in time.

아마.. 주로 쓰게될 것들은 didBegin / didEnd 아닐까 싶다.. ?
